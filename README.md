# go-payment

## Description
This is a payment module library for Go, designed to simplify the integration of various payment methods. Initially, 
it supports basic payments with processors like PayPal and Stripe, but it has the potential to be extended 
to accommodate other payment methods, including cash payments.

My goal is to have a library that can easily integrate with payment processors while also being flexible enough 
to support a range of payment methods in the future. Currently, this functions as a payment processor library, 
but the intention is for it to evolve into the core of a comprehensive payment module that can integrate with various 
transactional and management systems.

I wanted something that I can reuse that will go beyond simple PayPal and Stripe payments.
